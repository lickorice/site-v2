                  Developing your own speech model was very interesting actually. I'd say I was inspired by Shannon's
                  model—mainly because we share interests in the applications of communication in engineering and
                  technology.

                <p>
                  It puts you in the shoes of those people, and makes you realize how hard it was to quantize and
                  standardize communication, without standing in the shoulders of giants today.

                  Well, I'm proud of myself! Nothing really big defined my life. I believe it was just the gradual,
                  small experiences that really put me to where I am now. It's not like a soap opera or anime where I
                  have to have a dramatic backstory for everything, I guess.

                  This assessment helped me approach speeches as less of an audience, but more of a critic. I had to
                  point out persuasive strategies Phoenix used in his Oscar acceptance speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being a little more skeptical about everything isn't always harmful. Most times it draws the line
                  between gullible and attentive. Too much skepticism may be viewed as rude, but for this assessment, I
                  guess Joaquin Phoenix doesn't really mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Personally, I liked his speech. It felt like from the heart, in an audience standpoint. From the
                  Speech 30 standpoint, it really does exhibit good use persuasive strategies. I'm now much more aware
                  in (mentally) pointing out these in most speeches I listen to now!

                  Again, another mini-critique of one speech (of many!) by Rep. AOC about discrimination. Nothing really
                  new here, but it helped me classify speeches easier via the classical classifications
                  (mini-alliteration not intended) of rhetoric.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much like the earlier examples and more to come, this mainly helped me realize the presence of the
                  topic at hand in everyday situations. In this case, it was the three types of classical rhetoric:
                  deliberative, judicial, and ceremonial.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TL;DR: I believe her speech was mostly deliberative/legislative. Which is appropriate, since she's in
                  Congress.
                </p>

                  The midterm assessment was a fun project to make, especially since I make a good number of YouTube
                  videos myself. It was great practice in writing a script, projecting my voice, and editing the video.
                  It was like making an audiovisual tapestry!

                  This was one of the more lighthearted module assessments. I haven't really watched Friends before so I
                  came in here blind. It reminded me of Always Sunny's (must-watch!) remarks on evolution themselves!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Again, it was interesting to view these usual situations in a different light. I was writing the
                  assessment for ELM, and you could really see clearly how it worked in the scene.

                  There wasn't any lifestyle changes that happened to me in the quarantine, especially changes that had
                  to come from an external source. I didn't really get into anything because someone persuaded
                  me—usually I persuade myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My life before quarantine was great, it was well-balanced although a bit lacking on the aspects of
                  physical exercise. I'm working on that. So my life during quarantine isn't any different. It's
                  basically my life before minus the everyday physical social interaction I get.

                  The last "real" module assessment is another mini-critique on Boy Abunda's TEDx talk in ADMU. This
                  time, we inspect the five canons of rhetoric in the talk.

                <p>
                  It has been quite a while since I last heard, let alone listen to an actual thing by Tito Boy. I don't
                  watch any local television, but I know enough that he's a celebrity since my relatives watch local TV
                  quite religiously.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seeing him give a TEDx talk was quite refreshing really. It was intellectual and thought-provoking,
                  which is quite the opposite of what Tito Boy usually presents in show business. Don't get me wrong, he
                  is smart. That, coupled with his background in show businesses, gives us an intellectual and
                  well-delivered talk.

                  A speech about <span class="fw-bold emphasis">college being not for everyone</span>. This project was
                  just like the midterm assessment, but with a more formal tone. Again, I had fun writing out the speech

                  I really enjoyed the Speech 30 class under ma'am Sumilong! It's one of the few classes that takes the
                  edge off in quarantine. Even though I was absent a few times in class, I always looked forward to
                  attending it. It really did bring color to the monochrome atmosphere we have during the pandemic.

                  Despite it being delivered remotely, it felt like I was there. Somehow I was delivered from the
                  confines of my room into a classroom. The usual fatigue from staring at a bunch of rectangles on your
                  computer monitor during a Zoom meeting was absent, and I really liked that.
